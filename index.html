<h2>Sensors for Safety</h2>
<b></b>


<p>
Sensafy is start-up, developing solutions using sensors to increase safety for both persons and property. Our objective is to use standard sensors and create software that opens up new or improved uses.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of situations where monitoring with sensors can have a profound impact. E.g monitoring elderly living alone is already successfully done by others. Some solutions use door- and movement sensors; When reduced or abnormal movement is detected the caretaker is alerted. Other solutions use personal alarms that need to be carried around. These devices often contain: a panic button, GPS tracker or fall detection.  Some of these solutions work great but are expensive, and some systems have limited functionality. Sensafy aims at offering lower costs alternatives and enhanced functionality. 

</p>

  <p>
 With the rise of IOT (Internet Of Things) there are new uses. Nevertheless, sensors have been around for a longer time, like the Passive Infrared Detector (PIR) detecting movement and the door/windows sensors detecting opening and closing. The sensors that are currently on the market often come with very limited software. Sensafy develops enhanced software in order to transform raw sensor data in meaningful information in the form of reports and alerts, leading to new possibilities of mature technology.

  </p>
       
<p>
  Cameras as such cannot really be considered as sensors as humans are needed to interpret the images. However with the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) camera images can be interpreted without human interference therefore the output can be used similar to the output of classical sensors. One of Sensafy’s objectives is to develop solutions making use of data from these ‘smart’ sensors.
